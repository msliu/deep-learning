1. Loss Function
   Current data loss function used in CNN listed below:
   Euclidean loss, (square) hinge loss, information gain loss, contrastive loss, triplet loss, Softmax loss

   Def: We define the softmax loss as the combination of 
        A). a cross-entropy loss,
        B). a softmax function and
        C). the last fully connected layer
