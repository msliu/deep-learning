2.2 SAMPLE SPACE AND EVENTS
* Consider an experiment whose outcome is not predictable
* The set of all possible outcomes is known.
* This set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the sample space of the experiment and is denoted by S.

  ** If the outcome of an experiment consists in the determination of the sex of a newborn child 

     S = {g, b}

  ** If the outcome of an experiment is the order of finish in a race among the 7 horses
 
     S = {all 7! permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)}

* Any subset E of the sample space is known as an event

   Example 1, if E = {g}, then E is the event that the child is a girl.
   In Example 2, E = {all outcomes in S starting with a 3} then E is the event that horse 3 wins the race.
   .......

* For any two events E and F of a sample space S, we define the new event E ∪ F
  to consist of all outcomes that are either in E or in F or in both E and F.

     E ∪ F = {g, b}
